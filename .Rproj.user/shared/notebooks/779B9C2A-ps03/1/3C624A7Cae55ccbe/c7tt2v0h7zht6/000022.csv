"2","Warning: `modelsummary could not extract goodness-of-fit statistics from a model
of class ""mira"". The package tried a sequence of 2 helper functions:

performance::model_performance(model)
broom::glance(model)

One of these functions must return a one-row `data.frame`. The `modelsummary` website explains how to summarize unsupported models or add support for new models yourself:
