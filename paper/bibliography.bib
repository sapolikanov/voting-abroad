	abstract = {Abstract A common challenge in developmental research is the amount of incomplete and missing data that occurs from respondents failing to complete tasks or questionnaires, as well as from disengaging from the study (i.e., attrition). This missingness can lead to biases in parameter estimates and, hence, in the interpretation of findings. These biases can be addressed through statistical techniques that adjust for missing data, such as multiple imputation. Although multiple imputation is highly effective, it has not been widely adopted by developmental scientists given barriers such as lack of training or misconceptions about imputation methods. Utilizing default methods within statistical software programs like listwise deletion is common but may introduce additional bias. This manuscript is intended to provide practical guidelines for developmental researchers to follow when examining their data for missingness, making decisions about how to handle that missingness and reporting the extent of missing data biases and specific multiple imputation procedures in publications.},

	abstract = {Females and males often migrate at different rates. Official data on sex-specific international migration flows are missing for most countries, prohibiting comparative measures to identify and address inequalities. Here we use six methods to estimate male and female five-year bilateral migration flows between 200 countries from 1990 to 2020. We validate the estimates from each method through correlations of several migration measures with equivalent reported statistics in countries that collect flow data. We find that the Pseudo-Bayesian demographic accounting method performs consistently better than the other estimation methods for both female and male estimated flows. The estimates from all methods indicate a decline in the share of female migration flows from 1990â€“1995 to 2005â€“2010 followed by a recovery over the decade since 2010.},
